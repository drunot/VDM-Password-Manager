\chapter{Future Work} \label{chapt:future}

While this model is good at representing a password manager there are some
improvements that can be made in the future to make it even more representable.
For example when you log in right now it happens globally meaning that the data
for a logged in user can be accessed from anywhere which is not acceptable.
This is an oversight in the model that should be sorted out in the future.

For this model to be representing the distributed system that it probably will
be ending up running on, concurrency should also be worked into the model,
which is not done at the moment. Therefore there is some future work that needs
to be done for this model in order for it to be complete.
