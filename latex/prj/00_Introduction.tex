\chapter{Introduction}

In this report a VDM++ model of a Password Manager is described. The model is made as the mini-project part of the course Modeling of Critical systems.

The purpose of the report is to show an example of how a VDM++ model could be implemented and tested in this case in form of a Password Manager. Models are useful to test critical parts of a system. For Password Managers to be effective it is important to ensure that they are secure, and therefore creates a good case for a VDM++ model. Since the security aspects are in focus other aspects of the system is not covered by the model such as network and concurrent access to the database.
