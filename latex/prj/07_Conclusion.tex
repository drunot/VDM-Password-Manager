\chapter{Conclusion}

While the model might be simplified a little and there are some oversights as
described in \cref{chapt:future} this report and the model presented in it
shows how both testing can be done and how the model can be run with scenarios.
While the oversight is there, all the tests are passed and the coverage of the
model is close to complete and covers all of the critical parts of the model.
Therefore this model presents a fine example of how systems can be modeled in
VDM++.
